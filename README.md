# House_price_prediction
Predicting house prices is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts to make informed decisions. Using machine learning, we can forecast prices based on area demographics and property features.

Dataset:

Source: Kaggle

Features:

Avg. Area Income

Avg. Area House Age

Avg. Area Number of Rooms

Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms

Area Population

Address

Target Variable: Price (for Linear Regression)

Tech Stack & Tools

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Workflow

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing distributions, correlations, and patterns.

Model Training –

Linear Regression: Predict exact house prices

Logistic Regression: Predict high vs. low price category

Model Evaluation – Metrics include RMSE, R² for Linear Regression, and accuracy, precision, recall for Logistic Regression.

Streamlit App – Build an interactive web app to allow users to input features and get predicted house prices or price categories.

Results

Linear Regression achieved X RMSE and Y R² score

Logistic Regression achieved Z% accuracy in classifying high/low price houses

Key predictors: Average income, number of rooms, house age
